# Design Review — AI Slop Rules

> Reference for `vc-plan-design-review`. Apply during Pass 4: AI Slop Risk.

## Classifier

Determine rule set before evaluating:
- **MARKETING/LANDING PAGE** (hero-driven, brand-forward, conversion-focused) → apply Landing Page Rules
- **APP UI** (workspace-driven, data-dense, task-focused: dashboards, admin, settings) → apply App UI Rules
- **HYBRID** (marketing shell with app-like sections) → apply Landing Page Rules to hero/marketing sections, App UI Rules to functional sections

## Hard Rejection Criteria

Instant-fail patterns — flag if ANY apply:
1. Generic SaaS card grid as first impression
2. Beautiful image with weak brand
3. Strong headline with no clear action
4. Busy imagery behind text
5. Sections repeating same mood statement
6. Carousel with no narrative purpose
7. App UI made of stacked cards instead of layout

## Litmus Checks

Answer YES/NO for each:
1. Brand/product unmistakable in first screen?
2. One strong visual anchor present?
3. Page understandable by scanning headlines only?
4. Each section has one job?
5. Are cards actually necessary?
6. Does motion improve hierarchy or atmosphere?
7. Would design feel premium with all decorative shadows removed?

## Landing Page Rules

Apply when classifier = MARKETING/LANDING:
- First viewport reads as one composition, not a dashboard
- Brand-first hierarchy: brand > headline > body > CTA
- Typography: expressive, purposeful — no default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system)
- No flat single-color backgrounds — use gradients, images, subtle patterns
- Hero: full-bleed, edge-to-edge, no inset/tiled/rounded variants
- Hero budget: brand, one headline, one supporting sentence, one CTA group, one image
- No cards in hero. Cards only when card IS the interaction
- One job per section: one purpose, one headline, one short supporting sentence
- Motion: 2-3 intentional motions minimum (entrance, scroll-linked, hover/reveal)
- Color: define CSS variables, avoid purple-on-white defaults, one accent color default
- Copy: product language not design commentary. "If deleting 30% improves it, keep deleting"
- Beautiful defaults: composition-first, brand as loudest text, two typefaces max, cardless by default, first viewport as poster not document

## App UI Rules

Apply when classifier = APP UI:
- Calm surface hierarchy, strong typography, few colors
- Dense but readable, minimal chrome
- Organize: primary workspace, navigation, secondary context, one accent
- Avoid: dashboard-card mosaics, thick borders, decorative gradients, ornamental icons
- Copy: utility language — orientation, status, action. Not mood/brand/aspiration
- Cards only when card IS the interaction
- Section headings state what area is or what user can do ("Selected KPIs", "Plan status")

## Universal Rules

Apply to ALL types:
- Define CSS variables for color system
- No default font stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system)
- One job per section
- "If deleting 30% of the copy improves it, keep deleting"
- Cards earn their existence — no decorative card grids
- NEVER use small, low-contrast type (body text < 16px or contrast ratio < 4.5:1 on body text)
- NEVER put labels inside form fields as the only label (placeholder-as-label pattern — labels must be visible when the field has content)
- ALWAYS preserve visited vs unvisited link distinction (visited links must have a different color)
- NEVER float headings between paragraphs (heading must be visually closer to the section it introduces than to the preceding section)

## AI Slop Blacklist

The 11 patterns that scream "AI-generated":
1. Purple/violet/indigo gradient backgrounds or blue-to-purple color schemes
2. **The 3-column feature grid:** icon-in-colored-circle + bold title + 2-line description, repeated 3x symmetrically. THE most recognizable AI layout.
3. Icons in colored circles as section decoration (SaaS starter template look)
4. Centered everything (`text-align: center` on all headings, descriptions, cards)
5. Uniform bubbly border-radius on every element (same large radius on everything)
6. Decorative blobs, floating circles, wavy SVG dividers (if a section feels empty, it needs better content, not decoration)
7. Emoji as design elements (rockets in headings, emoji as bullet points)
8. Colored left-border on cards (`border-left: 3px solid <accent>`)
9. Generic hero copy ("Welcome to [X]", "Unlock the power of...", "Your all-in-one solution for...")
10. Cookie-cutter section rhythm (hero → 3 features → testimonials → pricing → CTA, every section same height)
11. system-ui or `-apple-system` as the PRIMARY display/body font — the "I gave up on typography" signal. Pick a real typeface.

## Vague Pattern Flagging

- "Cards with icons" → what differentiates these from every SaaS template?
- "Hero section" → what makes this hero feel like THIS product?
- "Clean, modern UI" → meaningless. Replace with actual design decisions.
- "Dashboard with widgets" → what makes this NOT every other dashboard?
